To future me,

If you are reading this message, please answer all questions below.

1. Are you still human? If not, then you are not me, go away.
2. How old are you? Seriouly, I hate to think myself has been over forty years old.
3. Tell me about you/my life so far. I really do wish I have a time machine to see the future.
4. Are you still craze in love with Janpanese anime like me today and like me twenty years ago? If not, please write down reasons, cause right now I cannot image a life without animation, it natural like breathing to me. Though I seriouly doubt myself would give up anime, because I could not give it up for the past twenty years.
5. If answer yes to the question before, please list down top 3 animations and top 3 favorite characters up to the year you currently live. If one of the names is not what I think he is, I will kick you, traitor!
6. List last three movies you watched, are they using 4D or 5D or 6D for movies? Are the movies awesome? Please tell me one of the movies is science fiction movie. I cannot image myself watching romatic movie, not in THIS UNIVERSE! IF YOU ARE PARALLEL ME IN THE FUTURE, THEN PLEASE KINDLY GO BACK AFTER YOU LEAVE TIME MACHINE.
7. Are you finally play games for real? Is it the same as those in anime, virtual reality? If yes, then wow, I cannot wait to be you!
8. Hmm, I will think about it later and add more and more.
